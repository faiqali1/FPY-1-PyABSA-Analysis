# FPY-1-PyABSA-Analysis

This repository contains the first part of my Final Year Project, which is an Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) on Shopee reviews. The project is mainly written in Jupyter Notebook.

The main file in this repository is PyABSA Aspect Extraction.ipynb, which contains all the analysis work done.

Please note that this README is created based on the current state of the repositories. The actual content and structure of the projects may vary as they are developed further
